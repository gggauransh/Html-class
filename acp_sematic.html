                <h1>Facts about cats </h1>
                <p>A house cat’s genome is 95.6 percent tiger, and they share many behaviors with their jungle
                    ancestors, says Layla Morgan
                    Wilde, a cat behavior expert and the founder of Cat Wisdom 101. These behaviors include scent
                    marking by scratching,
                    prey play, prey stalking, pouncing, chinning, and urine marking.
                    Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don’t taste sweetness.
                    Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better than that of
                    humans.
                    Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw).
                    Cats can jump up to six times their length.
                    Cats’ claws all curve downward, which means that they can’t climb down trees head-first. Instead,
                    they have toback down the trunk.</p>

                Cats’ collarbones don’t connect to their other bones, as these bones are buried in their shoulder
                muscles.
                Cats have 230 bones, while humans only have 206.
                Cats have an extra organ that allows them to taste scents on the air, which is why your cat stares at
                you with her mouth
                open from time to time.
