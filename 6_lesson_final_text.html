    <h3>Valorant is a free-to-play, team-based, tactical first-person shooter developed and published by Riot Games. The
        game
        pits two teams of five players against each other, with one team attacking and the other defending, in a series
        of
        rounds that culminate in a victory for the first team to reach 13 rounds. Players choose from a roster of unique
        "Agents," each with distinct abilities that influence gunplay and strategic plays.</h2>
